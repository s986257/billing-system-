INTRODUCTION :
A desktop program called the Billing System was created to effectively manage client billing details.  Constructed with MySQL for backend storage and PySide6 (Qt for Python) for the graphical user interface, the system offers a smooth method for managing, retrieving, and storing client transactions.  It's easy for users to create bills, enter client information, and store them in the database.  For small firms who want to digitize their billing process without utilizing sophisticated ERP systems, this project is perfect.
SYSTEM FEATURES:
In addition to the overall bill amount, the system lets users enter customer information including name, phone number, and email.  By using the phone number to determine whether a customer already exists, it avoids repeated entries.  In the event that the client is new, their charge is recorded and their information is saved.  To make sure all required fields are filled out before submitting data, the system offers error handling.  Successful billing is confirmed with a success message.
Technologies used:
This project creates an interactive desktop GUI using PySide6, a Python binding for Qt.  The backend database for safe and organized data storage is MySQL.  The Python program and the MySQL database can communicate thanks to the mysql-connector-python module.  Because of its modular design, the system is scalable and easy to expand in the future to include features like bill history tracking, product data, and invoice generating.
DATABASE SCHEMA :
Customers and Bills are the two primary tables in the project.  While the Bills table keeps track of the customer ID, total amount, and billing date, the Customers table keeps track of the customer's information, including name, phone number, and email.  A foreign key relationship connects the two tables, enabling the association of several bills with a single client.  In billing records, this form avoids redundancy and guarantees data consistency.
Conclusion :
A straightforward yet efficient instrument for handling consumer billing is the billing system.  The solution guarantees a dependable and seamless paying experience by integrating MySQL for data storage with PySide6 for the user interface.  This system is a useful tool for organizations and may be further improved with features like analytics dashboards, bill item data, and invoice production.
